# Final-year-Project-Heart-disease-prediction-
Its an live ongoing heart disease prediction project
The main objective of developing this project are:

❑To develop Machine learning tools to predict future possibility of heart
disease by implementing Ensemble.

❑ To determine significant risk factors based on medical dataset which may lead
to heart disease.

❑ To analyze feature selection methods and understand their working
principle. 


 As our project is on the beginning level, we are going through
Machine Learning gradually. So, currently we have not much
depth idea about it. We want to know more about Machine
Learning and will explore as much as possible in the upcoming
future.

 We will look for the accuracy also. We’ll try to make this
accuracy much better for making our prediction more accurate
and giving uniqueness to our project.
